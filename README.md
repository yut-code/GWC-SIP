# Programming Caesar's Cipher Starter Code
This is a place for you to start building your Programming Caesar's Cipher Project!

### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Share an opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Include user input for the initialMessage (only capital letters), the key, and the mode (encrypt or decrypt).
- Include a for loop that cycles through each character in the initialMessage.
- Include a conditional statement that allows for multiple word messages.
- Use a conditional statement to encrypt or decrypt the initialMessage based on user input.
- Use a conditional statement to adjust the position of any wraparound characters.
- Share the shiftedMessage with the user.


### Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Add another usability feature.
- Add a while loop to repeat the program.
- Explore other ciphers.
