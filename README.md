# Cracking Caesar's Cipher Starter Code
This is a place for you to start building your Cracking Caesar's Cipher Project!

### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Import the string library to access more characters.
- Share an opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Include user input for the encrypted message (capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and keyboard symbols).
- Include a for loop that cycles through all 93 key possibilities.
- Include a for loop that cycles through each character in the initialMessage.
- Include a conditional statement that allows for multiple word messages.
- Define and call a function called decrypt() that stores code that decrypts the ciphertext.
- Define and call a function called wraparound() that stores code to adjust the position of any wraparound characters.
- Display all 93 key possibilities in the console window using string formatting.
- Provide a closing message that shares with the user to search through the 93 possibilities to find their plaintext message.

### Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Add another usability feature.
- Add a while loop to repeat the program.
- Explore other ciphers.

## File Overview

### ← README.md

README.md file give you more documentation and information about a program. They are super helpful for describing what a program should do, any issues you've encountered, changes you want to make, and more. 

### ← main.py
This is where you will write your main program.
