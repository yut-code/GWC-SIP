# Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program
Jul - Aug 2022

This is the work I completed to earn certificates in cybersecurity, cryptography, web design and JavaScript!

There are two folders:

<h2>Cryptography</h2>
Using Python, I coded various bots which encrypts and decrypts messages w the caesar cipher and educate users on historical security breaches and the CIA Triad. 

<h2>Websites</h2>
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I coded a personality quiz and animal website that illustrates how to use flexbox, media queries, event listeners as well as DOM properties and methods to make a responsive website.
